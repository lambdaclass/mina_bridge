# Verifier circuit

This module contains the [o1js](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js) circuit used for recursively verify Mina state proofs.
A proof of the circuit will be constructed in subsequent modules for validating the state.

The code is written entirely in Typescript using the [o1js](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js) library and is heavily based on [Kimchi](https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/tree/master/kimchi)'s original verifier implementation.

## Structure

- `poly_commitment/`: Includes the `PolyComm` type and methods used for representing a polynomial commitment.
- `prover/`: Proof data and associated methods necessary to the verifier. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic is included here (`ProverProof.oracles()`).
- `serde/`: Mostly deserialization helpers for using data from the `verifier_circuit_tests/` module, like a proof made over a testing circuit.
- `util/`: Miscellaneous utility functions.
- `verifier/`: The protagonist code used for verifying a Kimchi + IPA + Pasta proof. Here:
    - `batch.ts/` includes the partial verification code used for verifying a batch of proofs.
    - `verifier.ts/` has the main circuit for verification, executes a final verification over a batch of partially verified proofs.
    - `sponge.ts/` has a custom sponge implementation which extends the `Poseidon.Sponge` type from [o1js](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js).
- `test/`: JSON data used for testing, which are derived from the `verifier_circuit_tests/`.
- `SRS.ts` contains a type representing a [Universal Reference String](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/urs.html?highlight=universal#universal-reference-string-urs) (but uses the old Structured Reference String name).
- `polynomial.ts` contains a type used for representing and operating with polynomials.
- `main.ts` is the main entrypoint of the module.
